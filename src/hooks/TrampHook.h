		// Class to set up a tarmpoline function hook in an external process.
		// It injects shell code into the target process and redirects execution of a function to this code.
		// The shell code has to contain a call of a placeholder address with the same calling convention as the origin function to ensure uninterrupted process execution.
		// This placeholder pointer in the shell code gets replaced with the address of the gateway/trampoline via pattern scanning at runtime.
		// It is neccessary to use a value unique within the shell code (eg. 0XDEADBEEF for x86) as the placeholder.
		// This pattern has to be passed as an argument on object construction.
		// When the origin function gets called by the target process (after enabling the hook) execution first jumps to the injected shell code.
		// At the call of the placeholder execution jumps to the gateway containing the overwritten bytes of the origin function and then jumps back to the origin function.
		// The stolen bytes overwritten by the jump from the origin function may not contain any references to data or code with static addresses.
		// Compiled to x64 the hook works both on x86 and x64 targets. Compiled to x86 it only works on x86 targets.
		// The shell code always has to be compiled for the same architecture as the target process.
		// The hook automatically uninstalls on desctuction of the installing object.
